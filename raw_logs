@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack its hard to do via twitter. I'm going to go register http://t.co/PiNsqPgNAa so we can have an info source Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack our fault >_> Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack we wouldn't want someone to tweet @CollectQT and get a different answer depending on who is online Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack with respect to issues regarding the group we would want people to be on the same page b/c Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack then in the next few hours / days / weeks we decide what we want to actually -do- Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack and we don't want to -do things- or -make big decisions- till we identify who we are already aligned with Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack like Lynn and Mallory have the same ideas right now Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack we want a group of people who are politcally 100% on the same page of us Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack not -contribute- really more like.... Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack so we get as many contributors as possible before starting the business plan thing Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack there's a chicken and egg issue here though of wanting to entice people with our goals Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara @_OpheliaBlack halp, need a lawyer Aug 09, 2014 
@_OpheliaBlack I'd rather the money go towards operation costs and savings. Pretty sure Mallory has the same idea. -Lynn Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara (partially because these things haven't been decided yet!) Aug 09, 2014 
@_OpheliaBlack clearly we need a business lawyer Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara if you want to elaborate on your concerns I'll RT them and catalogue them for later? Aug 09, 2014 
@_OpheliaBlack so income goes to organizers and workers Aug 09, 2014 
@_OpheliaBlack yea and we intend to be for profit Aug 09, 2014 
@0x0acebabe I'm not sure I'd want to moe TLD on this, it's a bit -too cute- IMO? -Lynn cc @mallorydoe Aug 09, 2014 
@mallorydoe which FWIW is the EXACT same issue people have with transhack Aug 09, 2014 
@mallorydoe not mad at you but mad at having to exist in a capitalist system that does this thing Aug 09, 2014 
@distransient FIENDS DISCRIMINATION Aug 09, 2014 
@mallorydoe can I qoute you on this? since I cant RT because secret Aug 09, 2014 
RT @distransient: @CollectQT there's a .coop TLD that's made specifically for cooperatives! Aug 09, 2014 
@distransient YES Aug 09, 2014 
RT @creatrixtiara: @CollectQT reminds me of Transgasm: http://t.co/zukIIFafVG Aug 09, 2014 
@creatrixtiara I can see how that would be a concern >_> Aug 09, 2014 
@mallorydoe yes but they dont have to be schemes moreso just the standard profitable enterprises that capitalism employs Aug 09, 2014 
@DrPalutena top level domain i.e. .org .com .me Aug 09, 2014

Also Lynn is currently a student and she's an organizer, so yes students 100% fine! ^_^ Aug 09, 2014 
And RE: positions I think the best way to go about it is to accumalate QTies until such point that we have enough skills for any one thing Aug 09, 2014 
RE: @Shufflejoy How exactly income distribution works is being left in the air until we get the core contributors group together Aug 09, 2014
RT @Shufflejoy: @CollectQT Whoa, hey, how's this income work? What kind of positions are you looking for? Can I work it around being a stud… Aug 09, 2014

Funding Structure
-----------------

Until such point that it's supporting enough people that money probably won't help the group grow more. Aug 09, 2014 
> and so money given to the group should initially have the primary purpose of helping the group grow. Aug 09, 2014 
The reasoning for providing income the people who are involved in a productive capacity is that to an extend the group wants to grow > Aug 09, 2014 
> a functional base salary for a small group of marginalized people who are involved with the group "in a productive capacity" Aug 09, 2014 
So this post ---> http://t.co/dsuuMX7Y39 uses the concept of a "base salary" and I think the best goal would be to provide > Aug 09, 2014 

While also providing economic benefit to trans people who don't -directly- make money off of the group effort. Aug 09, 2014 
So a quick note, the plan is to make a -for profit- entity whose goal is to provide a reasonable base income for a group of trans people Aug 09, 2014 
@faeriegoggles Also I'm not sure the non-profit is the right path for this, but that's up for discussion! -Lynn Aug 09, 2014

There's only one person making the decisions right now (is Lynn!) so I don't want to do -too much- Aug 09, 2014 
One of those groups is @TransHousingNet ! Aug 09, 2014 
So I originally wanted to follow only individuals but there's a very short list of groups that I think this group should be affiliated with! Aug 09, 2014 

With Double Union in particular... ---> https://t.co/Pxc3vGFjM1 @urbanroomsick Aug 09, 2014 
And with TransHack in particular I (Lynn) just want to work on the policy of respectful distance @urbanroomsick Aug 09, 2014 
So in general its important to be able to support an organization's technical merits but not their political ones @urbanroomsick Aug 09, 2014 RT @mallorydoe: @CollectQT @urbanroomsick i'm not familiar with transhack but the idea of a Respectful Distance Policy already sounds perfe… Aug 09, 2014 

The person should be a QT and agree with everything we've said here (obvious) And be endorsed by everyone else currently on PR (tentative) Aug 09, 2014 
That is, expanding who is allowed to do PR Aug 09, 2014 
So, tentative policy for expanding PR abilities Aug 09, 2014

So don't be cis inclusive -just yet- @mallorydoe Aug 09, 2014 
RT @mallorydoe: @CollectQT i suppose that depends on balancing forces to keep them from taking over. the priority has to be the most vulner… Aug 09, 2014 
Also! Making sure straight trans people aren't alienated by the wording Aug 09, 2014 
On the fence about whether this should be a cis queer inclusive thing Aug 09, 2014 
Make sure we aren't forgetting about WoC! Aug 09, 2014 
Thoughts: the group should lean fem? Aug 09, 2014 

RT @mallorydoe: just start populating housing associations and things. Aug 09, 2014 
RT @mallorydoe: by growing the stability and happiness and financial security of group 1, we can move them into group 3 too as they get cash Aug 09, 2014 
because then we'd just be redistributing the oppression, so to speak Aug 09, 2014 
There needs to be a serious effort to make sure that contributors are all fellow trans people with their own economic issues Aug 09, 2014 

and 3) people who contribute to the org in same way Aug 09, 2014 
2) people who benefit indirectly via all sorts of ways. even just by the ability to have a place to talk about stuff Aug 09, 2014 
1) people who directly benefit from the organization, financially and otherwise Aug 09, 2014 
So at a very high level, there should be three groups of people! Aug 09, 2014

RT @eiridescent: @CollectQT @Shufflejoy Open to folks who don't need the money helping out pro bono? Aug 09, 2014 

RE: @quatoria Skills we need -right now- include writers / organizers / tech people. But we want to leverage anyone who can work remote. Aug 09, 2014 
And then thirdly a group of QTies who don't have a a productive skillset yet but want to learn one so they can be -> https://t.co/UGLYtfQX2f Aug 09, 2014 
But then there's also going to be a defined group of volunteer professionals Aug 09, 2014 
So the core contributors group is going to be people who already have skills and want to apply them for the sake of income Aug 09, 2014 
The idea is to pay organizers / people who need money with the intent of moving them out of that group eventually @eiridescent @Shufflejoy Aug 09, 2014 
Yes that's a defined group of people that we're trying to flesh out! ---> https://t.co/jyADfltpna @eiridescent @Shufflejoy Aug 09, 2014
