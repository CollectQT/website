# We are CollectQT!

**CollectQT** is a bold new initiative to build a community and be a strong economic linking point for **Queer (Q)** and **Trans (T)** individuals. With a goal in building community first, game development will soon follow.

We here at **CollectQT** are seeking more individuals to join our team and help us build a stronger focus for Queer and Trans people not just in our community, but throughout the world.

Currently, **CollectQT** is seeking individuals skilled in writing, organizing, and artists. And unless a position is explicitly stated otherwise, **all of our positions are welcoming to the entry-level**.

If you can do one of these things, or several of these things, and are a **QT**, we want you to join our team.

The culture of **CollectQT** is very important. Because all of us are queer and trans individuals, and many of us of color, an atmosphere that reflects that is important. We are what people would call “reverse-racist” and “cis-phobic.”

We focus on fighting specifically the oppressive cultures that many of us face; racism, sexism, transmisogyny, ableism, and more.

If this sounds like something that is of interest to you, or someone you know, and you want to join our ranks, please be sure to message **[@CollectQT](https://twitter.com/CollectQT)** on Twitter!
