# CollectQT

---

## Goals

Be an economic linking point for QTies. Collect them into a stronger community. Be a primary income source for some (primarily people whose identity keeps them on the edge of the capitalist economy) and a secondary resource source for others (younger QTies, people still in school, people still living with family).

## Active Projects

* [Bloob Game!](https://gitorious.org/bloob_game/bloob_game/source/develop:) for [Ruin Game Jam](itch.io/jam/ruinjam2014)
* Creating group infrastructure (technical and otherwise)
* Developing a hella socialist charter
* Finding more rad QTies (Maybe YOU!!!)
* Building ties with other community organizations

## Culture

A strong focus on **accessibility** and **inclusion**. Example: despite being a tech based project, we're going to take the time to make sure the project doesn't read as 'too tech', or as 'too good' for entry level people.

Advocacy that reaches into 'counter-oppressive' culture. We're **'reverse racist'** and **'cis-phobic'**.

Advocacy that prioritizes the actual people experiencing the oppression. **Black Queer Trans Women** come first, everyone else is some degree of minion (see: 'Allies').

**'Allies'** are minions around here. Still working on the exact terminology but the basic concept is that ally-ship based upon race / gender / sexuality always works in such a way that the "ally" has power over the person in the group (because of systematic oppression). To help counter that structural force, allies shall be denoted as minions (or some variant there-of)

## Politics

We want to say our 'politics are intersectional' but saying that has no use if we don't specifically denote what intersections we actively are aware of. The group will have a focus on countering:

* **capitalism** - an economic system wherein the means of production are largely privately owned
* **transphobia** - fear or hate of trans people
* **ableism** - discrimination due to ability / disability
* **racism** - systematic oppression whose basis is race
* **misogyny** - discrimination against women
* **transmisogyny** - transphobia as applied to women, misogyny as applied to trans people

## Help Needed!

Unless **explicitly** stated otherwise, people who are just learning or at **entry level** are always welcome! People we need **now**:

* **Writers:** People to help write documents (like this one!)
* **Organizers:** People willing to help organize our efforts
* **Artists:** CollectQT needs iconography! And style!
* **Developers:** Computerers of all sorts

None of those are mutually exclusive! You can be several if you like! If you want to do any of those things and are a QT then tweet at [@CollectQT](https://twitter.com/CollectQT)! Someone will give you the run down ~

## Group Infrastructure

**QTCollector:** A group of QTies (people who ID as both queer and trans) who collectively share project ownership and benefit equally (indexed to need) from project resources. This group needs to stay small (4 ~ 10). You'll be expected to check in with the group fairly often (1 ~ 3 times a week).

**QTCommunity:** Initially a collection of QTies who we contract (i.e. there are going to be terms and we are going to pay them) work out to, put effort into teaching, and build things for. At some point this will expand to be inclusive of non-QT identites, but only after we have had a impact on a bunch of rad QTies.

**Advocates:** People, QT or otherwise, who want to help out in some way. Advocates work pro-bono / as volunteers. Non-QT advocates must be ok with being described as "minions" as opposed to "allies", and generally not insert their minion opinions into dicussions where they are unwarranted.

## Inspirations

* **[TransHack](http://www.transhack.org/)** - A hackathon and speaker series, helped spread the trans + tech thing
* **[DoubleUnion](https://www.doubleunion.org)** - feminist makerspace, forms a lot of the basis for how we run our organization
* **[TransHousingNetwork](http://www.transhousingnetwork.com/)** - housing network for trans people
* **[Quilted](http://quilted.coop)** - a QTPoC inclusive tech cooperative
* **[Zeal](https://medium.com/mammon-machine-zeal)** - a radical game zine with a bunch of trans writers
