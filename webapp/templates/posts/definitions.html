<h2>Culture and Politics</h2>

<p>We think actions are pretty important here. Words are also important, but politics can often mean a lot of talk without action to back it up. We create action alongside our politics by accomplishing the following goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Owning our own organizations</li>
<li>Broadening our activism to not be limited to working with small, neo-liberal non-profits (though those are cool, too!)</li>
<li>Working towards building new infrastructure, rather than applying band-aid fixes and hoping that older, outdated infrastructure will hold.</li>
</ul>

<p>Activism is only useful when it can be used to get work done. Talking about activism does not accomplish goals, acting on it does. Creating progress through activism is key to true, tangible change in today’s society. We are realistic in this, and are not about boycotting every cause that comes our way to look like the, “Ultimate Social Justice Champions.” and end up on the street as a result. The phrase, “Good enough for liberation work.” applies here. Nowhere does it say that to be a “true champion of social justice” one must starve, put themselves in a situation where they may become homeless, or otherwise, “Stick it to the system.” and endanger their own lives as a result.</p>

<h3>Definition: Cultural Resume</h3>

<p>A Cultural Resume is a list of items and/or presentable show of work which can display a person&#39;s standings or understandings of a culture related item. In the case of CollectQT, a cultural resume is required in order to ascertain or determine if an applicant represents the ideals that CQT stands for. These ideals are often social justice related views, such as understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li>institutional racism</li>
<li>cultural misogyny</li>
<li>transmisogyny and how it can often be fatal</li>
<li>whorephobia and various kinds of work that are not socially accepted</li>
</ul>

<p>and also the knowledge that:</p>

<ul>
<li>one cannot be oppressed by virtue of them being: cisgender, white, or masculine. The power differentials in society don’t work that way</li>
<li>accomplices are useful, whereas “allies” can be harmful</li>
<li>capitalism is inherently oppressive</li>
</ul>

<p>A cultural resume is needed in application to CQT to show that an applicant will fit in with the culture that CQT presents and supports on a daily basis.</p>

<h4>So just what counts as a Cultural Resume?</h4>

<p>A cultural resume can be as simple or elaborate as one desires, to present your views how you see fit. Items which can be on a cultural resume include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog posts! If you’ve written a blog or curate a tumblr community based around socially-aware causes, we’d love to see some samples.</li>
<li>Tweets and/or storify speaking up against bigotry or oppression</li>
<li>Show us your YouTube! If you’ve been on camera discussing social justice or causes that are important to you, show them off.</li>
<li>Anything else which shows us more about who you are, what causes you’re passionate about, and how those things align with what we do here at CQT!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why do I need a Cultural Resume to work for CQT?</h4>

<p>It is expected that most people will not enter CollectQT with a full understanding of all the concepts we describe, so the purpose of the cultural resume is appraise someone&#39;s capacity for understanding, empathy, and education, when the inevitable cultural issues do occur.</p>
