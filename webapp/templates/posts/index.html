<h2>Organizational Goals</h2>

<p>Be an economic linking point for QTies, by being a primary income source for some, and a secondary resource source for others</p>

<p>Enable QTies and accomplices to showcase meaningful work in order to help them transition into a new/better work force, or work for themselves.</p>

<p>Rebuild economic circles and internet infrastructure to better serve marginalized identities, working from the bottom up</p>

<h2>Culture and Politics</h2>

<p>A strong focus on accessibility, inclusion, and ownership. Example: despite being a tech based project, we&#39;re going to take the time to make sure the project doesn&#39;t read as &#39;too tech&#39;, or as &#39;too good&#39; for entry level people. We define ownership a bit differently than other companies, in that your thoughts, opinions, and contributions will be not only listened to - but applied to and used to improve CollectQT and the project you are working on. You’ll get to be a part of CQT more than you would at an organization that said you, “own” a project but handed off your involvement to one of their unpaid interns, for example. We want you to feel as proud of being an owner of CQT as we are!</p>

<p>Advocacy that reaches into counter-oppressive culture. We&#39;re very aware of race and gender identity in CQT, and ask that you should be, too--if you’re thinking of working with/for us. Our commitment to social justice can be seen throughout the tech, sex work, and communication fields. We aim to bring queer people, trans people, and our accomplices together to accomplish amazing things far into the future.</p>

<p>The way we practice pro-active advocacy prioritizes the actual people experiencing the oppression, starting from the bottom up. Specifically, Black queer trans women come first, with our efforts focusing on other marginalized and oppressed communities as our time and resources see fit.</p>

<p>Accomplices are what we call allies around here. We’re still trying to hammer down the exact terminology, but the basic concept is that ally-ship based upon race / gender / sexuality always works in such a way that the &quot;ally&quot; has power over the person in the group (because of systematic oppression). To help counter that structural force, allies shall be denoted as accomplices (or some variant there-of)</p>
