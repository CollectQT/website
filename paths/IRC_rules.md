# CollectQT IRC Rules

<br>

## ##CollectQT

Members only Channel ! You're only allowed in here if you're at least a CollectQT advisor. CollectQT contractors may also be allowed in here on a case by case basis, but may be asked to leave the channel at a moments notice, so that CollectQT can engage in secret internal business. The general atmosphere is casual, except when we are having a meeting.

## #CollectQT

CollectQT general pulic meeting and discussion area. Go here if you want to talk to CollectQT people but aren't allowed inside of ##CollectQT. The general atmostphere for this channel is very casual.

## #Quirell, (etc)...

CollectQT subprojects (example: Quirell), will often get their own IRC channels. These channels follow the same ruleset as #CollectQT, and you are free to have discussions you would have here in #CollectQT instead
