## Politics

We want to say our 'politics are intersectional' but saying that has no use if we don't specifically denote what intersections and systems we actively are aware of, those being:

* **whorephobia / slutshaming** - Sex is not a bad or shameful thing to have, and sex work is work just as much as being a cashier is work
* **capitalism** - An economic system wherein the means of production are largely privately owned. Capitalism is inherently oppressive.
* **transphobia** - Fear or hate of trans people
* **ableism** - Discrimination due to ability / disability
* **racism** - Systematic oppression whose basis is race.
* **misogyny** - Discrimination against women
* **transmisogyny** - Transphobia as applied to women, or misogyny as applied to trans people
