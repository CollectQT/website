## Goals

* Be an economic linking point for QTies. Collect them into a stronger community
* Be a primary income source for some, and a secondary resource source for others
* Rebuild economic circles and internet infrastructure to better serve QTies

## Our Members are Working On...

* [A funding site for QTies and activists](http://gitlab.com/atunit/atunit/tree/develop)
* [A safe and inclusive social network](http://https://gitlab.com/collectqt/quirell/issues)
* [Bloobs!](http://collectqt.me/bloobs) for [Ruin Game Jam](http://itch.io/jam/ruinjam2014)
* Finding more rad QTies (Maybe YOU!!!)
* Building ties with other community organizations

## Culture

A strong focus on **accessibility** and **inclusion**. Example: despite being a tech based project, we're going to take the time to make sure the project doesn't read as 'too tech', or as 'too good' for entry level people.

Advocacy that reaches into 'counter-oppressive' culture. We're **'reverse racist'** and **'cis-phobic'**. Our social justice party includes not only a warrior but also a mage, support, and a tank.

Advocacy that prioritizes the actual people experiencing the oppression. **Black Queer Trans Women** come first, everyone else is some degree of minion (see: 'Allies').

**'Allies'** are minions around here. Still working on the exact terminology but the basic concept is that ally-ship based upon race / gender / sexuality always works in such a way that the "ally" has power over the person in the group (because of systematic oppression). To help counter that structural force, allies shall be denoted as minions (or some variant there-of)

## Politics

We want to say our 'politics are intersectional' but saying that has no use if we don't specifically denote what intersections and systems we actively are aware of, those being:

* **whorephobia / slutshaming** - Sex is not a bad or shameful thing to have, and sex work is work just as much as being a cashier is work
* **capitalism** - An economic system wherein the means of production are largely privately owned. Capitalism is inherently oppressive.
* **transphobia** - Fear or hate of trans people
* **ableism** - Discrimination due to ability / disability
* **racism** - Systematic oppression whose basis is race.
* **misogyny** - Discrimination against women
* **transmisogyny** - Transphobia as applied to women, or misogyny as applied to trans people
