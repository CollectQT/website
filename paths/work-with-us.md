# Work with CollectQT!

<br/>

## CollectQT Culture

We at CollectQT are creating **our own definition of a professional** work environment. We like to be whimsical and relaxed while working and progressing towards completing our projects. We promote an atmosphere in which everybody can be comfortable, and do that by creating the most **inclusive, welcoming, and non-judgemental atmosphere possible**. This will make the CollectQT worktime conduct dramatically different from what you would experience at a company not run by a group of queer trans people. For example in chat have been known to discuss:

* how the **prison industrial complex** and monetization of force by the police contributes to racial oppression
* the **culture of queerness**, which often ends up lewd because... ([Model View Culture article about being gay on the internet](http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/gay-internet-witches-on-the-internet-get-more-kisses)).
* the new video one of our **sex worker friends / co-workers** just released
* the failings of any and every type of **respectability politics**
* how the **normative workplace culture** excludes and marginalizes disabled people for reasons that have nothing to do with their capacity to work

Because of the things we discuss, its **extremely important** to understand the culture and emotions your QT peers. It's up to everyone in CollectQT to communicate your own boundaries / triggers as well as be aware of people's boundaries / triggers, and quickly apologize and potentially take a conversation to another channel when needed.

## Becoming a QTCollector

Despite the name, you won't have to be responsible for rounding up other QTies (although we would like it!). The QTCollector's (henceforth QTCs) are the **backbone of the organization**, they are the primary do-ers of things. They think up rad queer ideas and then make them happen. Once we begin having money, **being a QTC will provide you an income**. Given that the group will be paying you, being a QTC comes with responsibilities:

* Dedicating at least **5 ~ 15 hours of work a week** to doing CollectQT things.
* **Attributing some of your work to CollectQT**
* **Be receptive** to CollectQT Organizers assigning work to you, on top of whatever work you are already doing

## Perks of being a part of CollectQT

So by now, you're asking yourself, "Okay, CollectQT, this all sounds great, but why do I want to join your team? What do I get out of it?"

The perks of working with CollectQT are...

* Being able to use CollectQT **platforms to host / boost** your stuff!
* **A team** full of a variety of skills to help you on your projects
* **A deciding vote** on CollectQT decisions
* When we incorporate, it will be as a coop and QTCs will all be **owners / workers**
* Once CollectQT is funded, all QTCs are paid **an equal percent** of our funds

## Who We are Seeking

Does our team sound like something you want to be a part of? Are you interested, and think that maybe you might be one of the people CollecQT is seeking? If you meet this criteria, we might just be looking for you!

* Queer-Trans People of Color
* People aligned with our culture (you'll be submitting a "cultural resume")
* People with the following skillsets
    * web developer, python preffered
    * artist (branding / logos / pixel art)
    * front end web designer
    * music and sound composition
    * writing / public relations / internet organizing

CollectQT acknowledges that being Queer and Trans is closely tied with the sex work community and homelessness. Many QTies are forced into sex work in order to get out of homelessness, to avoid homelessness, or sometimes sex work is the cause of becoming homeless due to whorephobia. Because of this close tie CollectQT gives hiring preference to those who have been, or currently are a sex worker or homeless if there are two equally qualified applicants.

## How To Apply

The application process for CollectQT is still being worked on, but if you know any of the current members of CollectQT, give them a **"work resume"** + **"cultural resume"** and some **social media** links. Everyone who applies to CollectQT gets voted on by the other members, so the process might take quite some time.
